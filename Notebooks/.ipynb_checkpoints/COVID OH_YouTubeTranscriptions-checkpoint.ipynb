       "\"hi everybody can you hear me great okay i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist at project echo and unm welcome everybody to our infectious disease office hours it is may 10th uh 12 noon mountain time and uh welcome uh to this uh weekly session with dr nestor sosa dr leslie hayes and the rest of our team i wanted to remind you to keep your um to keep your line muted and turn your camera on if you have that opportunity it's perfectly all right to eat and drink for many of you it's your lunch hour uh please be reminded that kent knows worthy our digital librarian will be putting in evidence-based evidence-guided material into the chat and i think you will enjoy getting that material and then 45 minutes after the hour you can get the cme link and even if you don't need cme please fill that out we do i'll look at that at least once a month and see how you are all doing and see how we can improve these sessions so without further ado going to turn it over to our leader dr nester sosa who is a professor in the department of internal medicine the infectious disease lead and he's our great champion here and he has a presentation followed by dr leslie hayes thank you thank you very much joanna so yes i'm amnestos i'm the infectious disease division chief here at unm let me share the screen putting on presentation mode okay so yes i um today i'm going to review several uh articles uh some of them are somewhat extensive so i'm going to be quick um the this photo i just want to make references for i found in one of the articles the the uh pink dots here are the the coronavirus and this is like the surface of a cell so so you have an idea how many how many viruses are you know trying to enter or touching on the in this on this cell i thought it was a nice a nice photograph so start with some good news before i give you some bad news essentially this is the graph that i actually got from dr shan update that she does here at unm on the on the kobe's hospitalization in the u.s and you can see obviously that there's a significant decrease if you compare with like november december where we were in hospitalization and where we are and and i'm showing this because i just read an article on mnwr on the forecast for the next few months and it was somewhat for me somewhat disappointed and i'm going to go through that the article is actually this is the name of the paper uh modeling of future copy 19 cases hospitalization and death um according to vaccination rates and and npi the non-pharmacolog pharmaceutical intervention um and actually what the cdc did they actually invited six different modeling teams from you know throughout the united states they gave them some general guide guidance on how to how to uh create some some potential scenarios and then these six modeling teams actually um did a prediction on what's going to happen with the cases hospitalizations and and death from kobe 19 in the next few months here in the us and these are some of the assumptions they actually have like a four four scenario they they put high vaccination or low vaccination and then moderate mpi or non pharmaceutical interventions and low so they have four possible uh situations high high low low or high low low highs so as you may imagine and these are the definitions of what they consider a high vaccination or a high mpi um estimation and what i found surprising were the results in all of this exercise they actually uh calculated the four scenarios and you can see here uh the low low low vaccination low mpi is obviously the the the solid line and and then low vaccination moderate and in all cases they predicted um sort of a search in the in late may early june despite the you know the effort to vaccinate people even the most optimistic scenario which is the the the one with the the line and the dot here uh still there's a there's a minimal increase number of cases obviously if no intervention is done there are more cases which could could be a you know close to 40 50 cases per week uh in the in the beginning of june uh but the good news if you're if you're an optimist is that that even in the worst scenario the cases are going to go down um right before the fall so so but but obviously this this study underlines the importance of continuing some type of non-uh pharmacological intervention as we move forward with the vaccination effort and how important it is to to try to convince people to get vaccinated because in in several these scenarios we're going to have a surge small surge in the number of hospitalization and cases and these are the number of death also with the same shape and this is really consistent uh among all the all the different uh modeling groups that did this exercise so i think that's that's the the message of these of this interesting publication there are some other leaders but i i wanted to highlight that that we we certainly need to to continue the effort in getting people vaccinated and getting some type of of mpis until we're really out of the woods or completely out of the pandemic the other the other article that i want to mention uh it's about a new vaccine i think several months ago i actually presented some data on the novavax vaccine and we haven't really talked about it a lot because you know although the headline has been um uh all of the pfizer moderna and astrosenic and johnson and you're gonna have like like uh uh get all the got all the attention from from the publication but i think nova box is another vaccine and just to just as a refresher this uh this is a recombinant protein vaccine that actually uses the the the spike protein and and the way they make it it's really interesting they use cell from from uh from an insect and they infected with a vacuum of virus which is a pathogen of of insects and they including the vacuum virus the gene to synthetize the profusion uh conformation of the s protein so basically the plant i'm sorry that the cells start producing this this s protein um which is the the surface protein from the from the uh sarsko ii and then this this because it's just a protein they usually combine it with a plant-based a saponin-based matrix m and i i think i presented this paper but the way they look under the microscope the the spike protein arranged and solves in this rosette this nice looking almost like a small flower and this is the the sapling uh matrix so it's a it's a it's a different uh sort of a cage and and this is the way that the the this vaccine is formulated with this adjuvant and then the rosettes of spike protein and that's what what administers so the story was actually published in the new england journal and it's the they actually publish the data of the nova box vaccine in south africa against the south african variant the the b1351 and what's interesting well they enrolled mostly young young patients um so they were like 4 000 patients in in this study 2000 in every group in the vaccine group and placebo group and they use one dose of the of the of the nova box vaccine in this relatively young population and the main the the the main finding was actually the efficacy was around 50 percent so and this is against again most of this patient had the the south african uh variance so so this is comparable um to some of the other studies with these uh with these uh with this variant which is one of the most troublesome and they actually divided patients uh because as you know in south africa there's a very high prevalence of hiv so they divided the the cohort among hiv positive and hiv negative and amongst among those who are hiv negative because it was around 60 so slightly slightly better than than the general 50 efficacy because that included some uh hiv patients and these are the graph basically the placebo and the vaccine we have we are now used to seeing this graph it was better obviously in those hiv negative it was more more of a separation between the cases in the in the placebo will keep going up as opposed to the know about vaccine which the cases are kind of flat but one of the most interesting finding of this study was what happened in the placebo group and is that those who receive a placebo if they had covered or did not have copied they have the same incidence of copy 19 which that means that that if you had copy before with this variant there's no protection you know so so that it was really surprising and interesting that that you had the same risk of developing covet if you were not vaccinated this is like the natural history of the disease people exposed to these new variants were as likely to get copied again as those who had copied already so so this basically in this well-def designed study to prove the efficacy of the vaccine they found this you know sort of uh serendipitous finding that that actually you have no protection and this is this is basically the timeline of the of the different variants in in south africa and you can see the square here or the rectangle is where they did the story most of the most of the cases were obviously uh due to the to the variant to the to the 501 v2 variant which is the the south african also known as the 351 so but this finding was kind of impressive that there's no protection against this this 351 even if you had kobe so if you were in the placebo same incident which was interesting um the other uh vaccine story that i want to share with you and this is something that we have asked do immunocompromised patients develop vaccines develop antibodies after vaccination are they protected and we are already starting to get data on these published data and this is a this is a publication from john hopkins in which they measure the antibody production in patients who had received solid organ uh transplants before so included liver kidney lung etc um this was the publication is a research letter um and and uh from from from from john hawkins and what they found uh and let me go let me uh take you through the to this table they basically notice that there were three types of patient patients who did not respond at all to the two doses of the vaccine those one negative those two negatives so no antibody response those who actually responded to the second dose but not to the first and those who responded to both so if you want to just simplify like around 54 of these patients had a good antibody response 46 did not so so obviously this is much less response as compared to immunocompetent patients where the responses are 99 98 percent almost everybody mounts a good antibody response and then the efficacy we know in clinical trials is around 94 to 95 and this is mrna vaccines um so that was the first phenomenon so obviously these solid organ transplant patients that are taking immunosuppressive um they they just just barely half of them a little bit more than half of them actually react to the to the vaccine and some of them have no reaction to the first law so a large percentage have no reaction but finally with the second dose they got a better a better response obviously there is sort of a an age related relationship the older you are the less likely you are to response it's it's always this way so almost 50 percent of those um over 60 had no no response so so a little bit less than that than the whole group the group as a whole there was no significant difference in the gender response and other factors was the the type of of organ um the the worst uh response was probably long with with 61 having no no immunity or no antibody production um obviously the pancreas is it was very small the number eighty percent but there were only four patients but definitely if you have lung compared to let's say liver or kidney that had a better a better uh response overall and also the the and this is something that we know from from infectious disease and and from transplant medicine that the longer you are from your transplant the better you are so you you see like those who were less than three years had a 63 non-response as opposed to those who were more than 12 years had only a 33 non-response so obviously if you if you if your patient is recently transplanted and was vaccinated he's more susceptible uh to have kobe because the lack of of response of the antibody so so i i really like this trial it was uh you know around 658 transplant subject it was not thousands of subjects but it starts to tell some story about it and there was also a difference i'm sorry i forgot to mention about the different if if the patient was on a mycophenolate or one of these anti-metabolites either mycophenolate or acetioprine um the response was much less than if it was only on prednisone and and cyclosporine so so there's also a difference of what they are receiving currently uh to the degree of of immune response to the to the vaccines to the mrna vaccines the other paper that i i'm just going to summarize in one table is the durability of a humeral immune response to to sars kobe 2 this is um it's going to be published in some reports and i just like the the graph of these the summary graph of this paper uh which was sort of a complicated immune paper and i'm not going to go through all the details but to make a long story short this is sort of the evaluation of the of the humeral immunity response to sarcobit ii um as measured by antibodies again the spike in patients who have the natural infection and and to make a long story short both the memory b cells and the igg anti-spike antibody last for at least six months what we lose relatively early are the igm as you might expect and the neutralization okay but at least there's evidence of sort of a long-lasting eight-month in this case 31 32 weeks um off of the antibody producing b cells and also some of the antibody cell uh cytotoxicity so these are probably the longest uh you know follow-up publications on on the the natural infection duration of immunity which is already around eight months according to these these authors and finally it's been a while since i have presented anything on therapy we have really concentrated on vaccine but i i thought it was important you remember the recovery trial was the one that gave us the dexamethasone recommendation is this this real life or close to real life trial that they're doing in in the uk with with thousands of patients uh randomized to different arms so now they finally published because i have seen this in pre-publication but they finally published the il-6 inhibitor toscillis map in hospitalized patient and actually um is the second drug that clearly demonstrates decreasing mortality together with the dexamethasone now we have the tosaliso map and and a high percentage of patients who are receiving um so i'm going to go through this uh trial so it was published in the lancet a few days ago to silicon map and patients admitted to the hospital would cover it so these were all sorts of you know patients with with um with copic diagnosis and you can see these are the the two groups so 63 uh years is the mean age so they were sort of the the high high group and in fact they had like almost one quarter of them were over 70 so this was definitely different from the from the vaccine study we saw from south africa and there were there was also significant ventilatory support so so more or less 50 of the patient with either a non-invasive ventilation or already on mechanical ventilation so these were patients with you know fairly um severe or advanced uh kobe uh infection or kobe 19 infection they ended up randomizing 2000 in each arm so conventional therapy versus for versus docile isumab and this is all the whole design the whole recovery if you remember was over twenty thousand patients and these are all the arms called xenonsation uh acetomycin etc but but this is just concentrating on the tosilizumab and to make a long story short they found a benefit modest but but a very um solid difference in in the mortality and also in the possibility or probability of being discharged our lives so so to to positive outcome and you can see the kaplan mayor um of being discharged alive always better with the with the tosylisimap group compared to the standard of care and then it was also consistent across all patients age gender racial or ethnicity uh if you were on ventilator support or not they were you know most of the most of these findings were to the left favoring the tosilisium up and obviously the the overall overall benefit was uh with with a risk ratio of point uh 85 so means 15 percent better uh uh probability of survival at 28 days with the silicon map and then numerically so it was 15 percent for 28 day mortality at 20 to 22 better chance of being discharged also there was less risk of renal failure and less risk of developing or going on to the need mechanical ventilation so pretty positive i mean not dramatic i mean we're not talking 80 decrease in mortality we're talking 15 to 20 percent decrease in all this risk factor but nevertheless something better than that we have seen with other drugs like hydroxychloroquine even rendezvous has not been able to prove decreased mortality overall so that that was a positive and this is sort of a summary of all the studies um now with the recovery added to all the studies of ilisumab we can see that the the this forest plot is to the left so there's some benefits i think uh people after they they have time to digest this recovery star story uh i think some of the maybe the the nih or the idsa will move toward a more recommendation of this tosilism up in the in the future that that's sort of my my guess especially for patients who are hospitalized with increasing inflammatory markers and finally just one graph uh um about about the the b117 before we we presented this data here at the office hours uh we said that the there was a fight between the b117 and the california strains now the most recent um data on on our on our uh on our or the strains or the variance of concern you can see that now the the light orange b117 it's almost 60 it has really um defeated the 429 one of the california strains and some of the older all the original uh strains so now this is the most common throughout the united states and it's also the case for new mexico according to the the group that is working uh on this information here in the in the in the department of health in unm and the national laboratories okay i think that was it thank you thanks thank you dr sosa so much um i wanted to quickly turn it over to dr leslie hayes our primary care and addiction specialist hi thank you um so dr sosa i think you need to convince the id folks to come up with a different name than either the b117 because those are too hard to remember but i agree that the place names are not correct so i think maybe name them like they do hurricanes name them after you know uh people or something but we need a different naming system for them so i agree so there were some questions last week about vaccine hesitancy so i'm going to talk today about how to address vaccine hesitancies so and just some general advice if you're trying to talk to patients about vaccine first off all of this works better if you have a positive relationship with the person you're trying to convince you know don't even bother with aunt muriel who thinks you're an idiot because of who you voted for president last year it's just not good focus on people you already have a good relationship with second is to try to really listen and you don't want to listen with the idea of refuting the argument or um but you really want to listen and attempt to understand their concerns and i must say that this one actually um when i was in college i was having a political argument with someone i don't even remember what it was about but i remember that person sat down and listened to me for about 15 minutes and then recited my argument back and then said you know i still don't think i agree with you and that persuaded me to their point of view better than anything they could have said um so if you really understand people's um concerns it really does go a long way to being able to talk to them about it um know the science and be prepared to discuss it but also use anecdotes people really like anecdotes and it's been shown that it actually helps to get people to um take things more seriously so have anecdotes both about cobit patients who've gotten really sick or developed long covered and also anecdotes about the vaccine and um motivational interviewing is really great in this scenario um i found this wonderful article about something called the case approach which i've never heard of before um it was published in minnesota medicine in the march and april issue and k stands for corroborate a is about me s is the science and e is explained and advised so basically um first off you do what we already talked about is the listing very carefully and then you frame a response that corroborates what they've said um it's you know sort of discussing what their concerns are and then you make an about me statement which is sort of how you feel about it how you approached it then as you talk about the science underlying the recommendation and um or explaining their concerns and then finally explain your advice to the patient and i'm going to give an example but i really encourage you to go read the articles because they've got about six different examples of how to use this and it was just so helpful so patient 2 feels like the vaccine was rushed i'm hearing this first off you sort of corroborate so it does seem like the vaccine came out very quickly compared to the usual time course for vaccines and then say about me so i say i i truly was a little bit worried about how quickly it came out um until i did some reading and then i talked about the science when i did the reading i discovered that they actually went through all the steps they usually do for vaccines they just did it a lot more efficiently than usual because of the urgency of the situation and then explain in advice as your doctor i feel the vaccine is safe and they've done adequate study when you get it um and like i said you might want to look at the article because it really was a very helpful article on explaining how to use these and then some specific arguments um that my covet physician group has come up with online that i thought were useful we don't know the long-term effects of the vaccine and while this is true vaccines rarely cause long-term effects and we do know that covid causes plenty of long-term effects including lung disease heart disease diabetes and neurological symptoms and people who talk about the death rate is low for younger people again talk about the long-term effects and then i find this the most puzzling art argument that people but i hear this from people a lot i have a lot of health problems i am afraid the vaccine will make them worse and so with these help to talk about the patients may feel bad for a few days but it's rare that the vaccine causes any long-term worsening of health problems and they are at significant risk of problems from cobalt if they get it because of their health problems and then this was another one i really liked i'm young and i'm unlikely to get sick from cobit what does it matter to me and people said they've had really good success talking with about as long as young people are getting coveted they will be passing it on to more vulnerable people and we're going to have to continue the restrictions the sooner we can get sufficient number of young people vaccinated the sooner we can begin to lift the restrictions and people are saying they've actually had pretty good response to that particular argument and then i was a little embarrassed this last week one of my um patients called and she said i don't know if i want to get this vaccine they said it's not fda approved and so i was able to sort of go through and explain to her why um you know i still felt it was safe but i realized i didn't fully know the difference between fda approval and emergency use authorization unfortunately i was reasonably close and this is from the fda website and emergency use authorization means that the they feel there's good enough data but there's not as much data as would be needed for fda approval but they do have to have enough data to say that the intervention is safe and affected for its intended use and that the product can be made according to federal quality standards and they carefully balance all the potential risks and benefits of the product so even though it's not quite as strong of data as needed for fda approval it's still pretty strong and then this was very very interesting this woman is heather simpson and she was a big anti-vaccine advocate in texas for a few years and she ended up deciding she wanted to get the copic shot and so this article was just about her and why she decided to get it and then um i think i've mentioned your local epidemiology she actually did an interview with her and it's well worth reading just to kind of understand sort of the anti-vaccine mindset and there are a few things i got out of this from uh reading what she had to say so heather simpson became an anti-vaxxer she was i think considering or had just gotten pregnant and wanted to learn a little bit more about um vaccines and she said she ended up watching a nine-hour documentary that she found on facebook and she said she was especially convinced when she found a half dozen anti-vaccine doctors and i believe the anti-vaccine or kind of math vaccine doctors are very very harmful because people really do pay attention to them and she said if you're at all prone to fear it was very hard not to be convinced by this documentary which really um you know went after the fear and so she said she posted a mildly anti-vaccine post on facebook and she received many friend requests from anti-vaccine advocates and she also said she got a lot of vitriol from pro-vaccine forces and she states to solidify her anti-vaxx resolve so you know think about it if you see an anti-vaxx post maybe not attack the person because that often can push them further into the other camp and she said eventually she got frustrated because people were just opposed to anything medical and she had needed something medical and she started looking at the other side and she actually pointed out there's a spectrum from vaccine hesitant to extreme anti-vaxx and she said you know sort of first is vaccine hesitant then people who are just scared but not necessarily going one way or the other ex-faxers are people who had vaccinated their kids and their kids afterwards developed something such as adhd or autism spectrum disorder and they didn't have a good explanation for it and so they just chose the vaccines then the people who are 100 natural don't want to do any supplements um like conspiracy theorists and then what she referred to as the lizard people who are sort of extreme um conspiracy theorists and she said for the people who are just scared often just getting them the facts and if you can get them the facts before they've really gone down the anti-vaxx rabbit hole it can be very helpful so these are the people who often will respond to facts and understanding how things work um for the x facts there's one thing she said and this is obviously not a short-term solution but we need to get alternate explanations besides the vaccine for why children are developing autism spectrum disorder or adhd or some of these other conditions because right now often we don't have a good explanation for why children develop these and so it's easy for people to latch onto vaccine 100 natural the people who won't touch any pharmaceuticals i must admit i haven't had great success with these although some of them i do find it interesting um you know won't take the vaccines but they will take antibiotics them for these conditions when they get them and so i will talk to them sort of about what i view as the risk antibiotics and why i would much i'd take 50 flu shots over an extra course of antibiotics and that can sometimes be helpful um like conspiracy theorists i have found that sometimes we'll respond to actual conspiracies on the other side and um one thing and i i don't remember where this was but the media literacy um uh group out of albuquerque several years ago had a video where they taught teens about cigarette advertising and sort of all of the um uh manipulation and everything that goes into cigarette ads and it made them very strong um anti-tobacco ad um advocates and so realizing that you know because initially that they kind of thought there was smoking but then they realized the conspiracy was actually from the tobacco companies and the extreme anti-vaxxers are probably not worth spending a lot of time on at this point because you're probably not going to make much of a difference there and then paid people and i was unable to find actually the original research um that this article from the new york times was based on but uh it was on based on data from the ucla covered 19 health and politics project and so they said if we give you 100 bucks but this make you more or less likely to get a vaccine and 34 said they would be more likely 15 actually said they'd be less likely because they were like oh if they're paying me there must be something wrong with it um so you increased it about 19 if you offered people money for it a little bit less if you offered them less money and then they also found that the possibility that you could go without a mask was an incentive but interestingly people who are unvaccinated often don't think they need a mask so if you looked at um the likelihood of people um getting the vaccine if they no longer had to wear a mask um versus still having to wear a mask it went up they divided it out by all these different groups it went up the most in republicans um more in white people than black people overall it people were 13 percent more likely to get the vaccine if they thought they could um stop wearing a mask but interestingly the number of people in the last two weeks who died at a restaurant who were not vaccinated was 53 fully vaccinated 32 percent of them dined at a restaurant um gathering outdoors with more than 10 um non-family members um again the non-vaccinated were more likely to do that so um they may not they need so to begin with so that may not be much of an incentive to get them vaccinated for a lot of people and then some interesting articles um uh evaluation and management of code 19 in pregnancy and contemporary ob gyn was just a good summary of all the literature on coping 19 in pregnancy and in my family my daughter got pfizer so she is refers to herself as team pfizer most of the rest of us got moderna and my son got johnson and johnson and we have all sorts of ridiculous arguments about who's the coolest because of which vaccine we got but this was a pretty funny article about why johnson johnson is the coolest and then this was a nice article by i believe she's either a pediatric infectious disease doctor or pediatric hospital so i can't remember which um on kids vaccines are on the way and why um uh parents should get that vaccine if you want to show it to any of the parents in your practice so and that was everything i have thank you dr hayes fantastic really good skills and communication points for us all about vaccine hesitancy and i wanted to introduce dr cecilia thompson cecilia are you are you there mrs one of the medical directors at tricor i am here i don't have anything to update today but i'm happy to take any questions regarding testing fantastic uh thank you cecilia and i think uh we don't have marla sivers on on the call uh just yet today um but i'm gonna turn it over to dr thornton thank you joanna hi everyone carla thornton here with infectious diseases at unm um nice to see everybody so we have a bunch of questions i'm just going to start from the earlier ones um this can be for either of you uh dr ellen caro was asking will new mexico pursue pursue herd immunity as others give up on that goal any any thoughts about that so dr fauci actually had an interview on npr last week and he said no we're not giving up on herd immunity he said the problem is it's just hard to have that as your goal because we don't really know what the threshold is and he said our goal is still to vaccinate as many people as possible so it's not like they've given up it's just sort of they've changed the goal to just being let's just keep vaccinating and figure out how to get as many people as we can vaccinated thanks leslie nest or anything no i i mean for me it's like saving money to for my retirement i mean i'm not gonna say i'm gonna save a million dollar if i save a million and a half it's i'm happier if i say you know two million so i think it's it's you have to make the best effort to vaccinate as many people as possible you don't you're not going to stop at 65 or 70 or 75 just get everybody vaccinated and we get this over i mean the the the hair immunity is just a concept epidemiological concept but in reality the reality is that you try to vaccinate as many people and fight hesitancy etc i think that's that's the key not obsessed on a number thank you nester in reference to the the information you gave about the transplant patients leslie hayes was asking should we check antibody levels in patients with organ transplant after vaccine to document immunity sorry yeah i haven't really thought about it um if but if if anything it would be in that in that population if you if you if you're going to measure in somebody or in some group it would be immunosuppressed to see but we need to have a correlator protection which is i'm not sure we have a complete clear idea that what level of antibodies protection and which one is not it's it's a little bit more complicated i mean there have been efforts by research groups to try to find a correlate between neutralizing antibodies and and vaccine efficacy but it's hard you know when there's so many commercially available and maybe cecilia can make a comment on these two uh to say okay you have whatever 3.5 you know level of antibiotics protected or not it's kind of hard for me to to to find that magic number go ahead yeah and i'll just add that there are um diagnostic tests available to determine whether you have antibodies that are due to vaccine or due to natural immunity but nestor's right there's no cut off for whether this is a protective level of antibody or not those studies are still ongoing so they're not part of the diagnostic test thank you very much um john foster asked a really interesting and important question can you explain the mechanism of why vaccines appear to provide better protection than natural infection which doesn't seem to be the case for most other infectious diseases right i can try to speculate a little bit based on what i have read in the uh especially the discussions of the papers about immunity and is that the natural infection when you when you're dealing with the virus the virus does have like inhibitors of the immune system so the virus tries hard to fight your immune system and and uh they are like you know uh proteins in the in the virus especially the the open reading frame that that antagonize the interferon etc so you do not mount a perfect immune response as opposed to when you are vaccinated and then you have a booster again uh there is a more robust specific uh antibody with all the you know the anti immune system proteins that may be playing a factor when you are sick with covet so that's that's the best explanation that people can come up uh and and another reason for the for getting the the vaccine even if you have kobe you know you have to get a dose of the vaccine and then you mount a more robust immune system because the virus doesn't allow you to mount the ideal immune response because that's part of the mechanism in which he he um he's successful you know causing disease impairing your your ability to respond to it great thank you necessarily um i'm gonna see if julie brockmeyer if you can if you have audio can you admit yourself and ask your question yes my question was in regards to the recent um recommendations for how soon after getting being positive with covid you should get the vaccine i know that the cdc has said 90 days i know that i've also heard two weeks um i am talking about a a patient without comorbidities who was non-hospitalized but still has myalgias and three weeks out right that's that's a good question i don't think we have like a definitive answers and i've seen two schools those who who recommend vaccination as soon as possible in order not to miss an opportunity to vaccinate so if you have somebody who's under your care and hackability let's say a month ago you can probably vaccinate him right there if you think he's going to be lost a follow-up or you're not going to see him again because there's no there's no absolute contraindication for vaccination the idea of the three-month uh it's number one to because that person presumably during those first three months after kobe um it's somewhat protected from having a reinfection so there's no rush and if you want to use that dose on an unvaccinated people or person it's even better because you're using the dose more rationally when a person has zero protection versus somebody who maybe has an 80 percent protection from the natural infection so that's that's the other reason i recently actually last week i reviewed a paper in which for the first time they tried to see the immune response on those who had copied um uh in association with the time when they were vaccinated and there seems to be like a sweet spot after a month of having kobe you get a better response a better antibody response so if you get the vaccine too close to the acute infection you're you're not going to mount a a pretty good uh antibody level so there's there's some data now coming out that probably you have to wait a little bit at least a month but you can safely wait you know more than that because you're protected from a reinfection so from a sort of a epidemiological point of view you can wait up to the three months which is which is from some of the recommendations so but that's the data that we have and the second part to that was um i have heard and i don't know if this is anecdotal or not that sometimes getting the vaccine will cure those symptoms right there yeah that's that's another good question for people who would long call it uh there have been a few studies that are showing that after vaccination patients with long-coverage symptoms a percentage not all of them and it's not you know like super dramatic there is a percentage of them who actually improve and no and there's no evidence that they get worse so so the the you know it's not a hundred percent the paper that i review is more around around 25 percent of those who have done copy had an improvement in their symptoms obviously if you're one of those you're going to say oh i got much better than the vaccine but there's some other in the in the surveys that actually didn't improve dramatically after vaccination uh but there is at least the reassurance that that most of them got better or at least didn't didn't didn't get any worse thank you thank you julie for those great questions um nestor uh harry seibold had a question about it looked like on your slide uh in the tesla map study that the people that were older than 80 years of age did not have um benefit is that is that correct yeah i would have to go back to the paper i don't remember and i'm wondering if that is because of the small number of patients in that group i am i would have to review the slides let me go back here okay and well um yeah it was to the left just to answer it was to the left of the graph it's just that it crossed one the the confidence interval were basically crossing one but the but the the mean was to the left so it was beneficial but it was too broad of a confidence interval because of the number of subjects um in in that uh in that group great thank you so much um we have a question about the brazil variant any any um information about that necessary that you have no i i review i mean we will review here uh uh a couple of papers on the immune response and um there is a there is an immune response and they are neutralizing antibodies they are not affected the the neutralizing antibodies especially the mrna vaccines induce antibodies which are in between the the uk and the south africans so the brazilian in the in the antibody levels it's sort of in between the worst case scenario would be the south african which is the one that that you generate less um less of a neutralizing antibody the uk seems to be almost unaffected by by regarding neutralizing antibodies so the brazilian seems to be in between the two the south african and uh and the uk variant but that's that's the only thing i have seen obviously there is a concern on the ground in brazil because they're using um one of the chinese vaccine the corona back that is not very effective but this is just anecdotal i mean we don't have data on on efficacy specifically against the brazilian uh strain in in in clinical stories thank you um i wanted to see also if anne corley slain if you if you have audio if you can ask your question because it has a several different parts to it and if you can just introduce yourself sure my name's anne corliss lane i'm actually an infection preventionist nurse in michigan um so i've been doing a lot of studying with virology and just trying to learn about the whole process of the mutant virus and what i've been trying to research is if there's actually any clinical studies proving that those variants are more contagious or do they have a higher binding affinity with the ace receptors or is it just kind of coincidental because the rate counts are going higher you know if you have higher rates you're going to have more deaths people have been a little bit more lacks on the npis so is it just kind of a coincidental thing or are these mutant viruses actually more transmissible yeah that's a i want to take that one it's a great question uh and and this question has been sort of put uh it's in several you know different discussion forum well there's so many evidence the the fact that that the new variant like the uk variant basically overrun all of the other previous variants suggest that there's an advantage in transmission so that's sort of an epidemiological thing if you have two variants competing for the same population and you see one becoming more and more common one of the likely explanation is that it's more transmissible so there's sort of a an indirect conclusion there's also evidence of a higher viral load uh in patients with these new variants when they compare the ct values of some of the patients with the old variants with the wuhan the original and those with with this mutation including the the 614 and and the the really variance of concern that the like the brazilian and the uk variants they seem to be more transmissible and they seem to have a higher vital load and they're trying to find explanations it's a little bit more difficult to find why that is happening uh they think that their the changes in the spike protein produces more con conformational changes in the spike and makes it more available for the receptors but i think that's that's a little bit more complicated to understand but there is both epidemiological clinical and also some basic science um uh sort of explanations to to understand what there's more transmissibility regarding severity at the beginning the the people the groups in the uk actually published that the uk environment seemed to be more severe but there have been two publications recently which basically have put that in doubt they they actually compare uh patients with and without the uk variant and they couldn't find um really you know measures of severity uh when they look at a more specific hospitalized population with both uh with either the uk or some of the original variants so i think transmissibility is accepted as a that it occurs and and um severity we're still um not sure that it's more severe that any of these variants are are really more severe what the brazilians are saying is that it's affecting younger population but we don't really know if it's a if it's sort of a consequence of vaccination of all the groups they're still looking into that into that data great thank you so much great thank you so much that's super helpful i'm gonna go ahead and just turn it back over to joanna further questions great thank you carla so much um thank you guys for all these amazing questions today too and for the hub team for providing all these uh um kind of evidence-based and evidence-guided answers there's a a question from dr yehuda pat about the indian indian variant and how the vaccine might affects that might affect that nestor and then i think dr mertz um has a question about a physician from rutgers who died over in india um uh who had been fully vaccinated in the u.s and wanted to see if you could address that um as well right i haven't really seen any papers uh on correlation with the so-called indian marian which is the b1 617 i wrote it down here because there's so many numbers i'm even i'm going crazy with all these numbers so the 617 which is the so-called indian baron has the e uh 4a4 mutation which is one of those mutant uh you know mutations associated with immune escape uh but i haven't really seen any graph comparing you know level and neutralizing antibodies with the so-called indian uh i think it's a it's a bit too soon we'll probably see it in the next few weeks and i've been waiting for the pre-publications but i haven't really seen it maybe out there but but i don't i do not really know uh how the best is and i heard about this uh physician who was fully vaccinated i think he was in the 80s so that he was 80 years old so that may be a factor and there's definitely breakthrough infections even without variance there could be breakthrough infections we know that there have been a few uh thousands of breakthrough infections in the in the united states so it's it's possible um but it's also possible that he was infected with the variant that was not uh adequately controlled by the immune response to the original vaccine i saw something online about him and it did say that um although he had covered he was never severely ill and so the vaccine did seem to protect him from severe illness he had underlying heart disease and in all likelihood the code precipitated the heart attack but he did not die from the severe cobalt he died from his underlying condition that was brought out by it so the vaccine does seem like it at least in part did what it was supposed to do thank you thank you nestor thank you leslie um maria christina garcia has a question about the vaccines against the p2 variant from from brazil and i think you've mentioned credit you mentioned um we've kind of discussed this already so i might go on to um excuse me excuse me um and then i and deborah hill mentioned um deborah hill also uh questions about should um uh guidance about people who um we have received guidance that those who are fully vaccinated two weeks out to three months out would not be considered a close oh deborah do you want to maybe an un unmute and ask your question um i thought it was a different type of question but i don't think we've addressed this no yeah sure thank you um so we've been given guidance as school nurses and others that um folks who have been fully vaccinated which means two weeks out have three months where they are not considered a close contact but we have so many people now who are beyond the three months and i've been looking around and i'm trying to figure out what is the guidance that we give um to folks who are over the three-month mark are they still considered no need to quarantine not close contact do we have any any word on extension of that time that's that's what does that make sense yeah that's a great question i don't think we have the answer yet i think this the cdc is waiting for more data on the durability of the protection we saw some data from the phase two of moderna that at least went out to four months but we haven't really seen anything beyond because people have been vaccinated just you know the last three three or four months but you're right there are people who were vaccinated late december early january and and uh except for those who participate in clinical trials the real life vaccination started in january in most places so so yeah we're five months out we need we need new guidance on this how long the protection is gonna last uh i have heard about the so-called booster that we need a booster at some point maybe at the six-month point or something but we still need more data and i think the cdc is like scrambling to find more evidence of how long the protection really lasts to to be able to extend their their recommendations on on when a person is fully vaccinated if you're five or six months out are you still fully protected or not that's that's a great question uh thank you for that great question uh deborah um kim joy has a question um nester and leslie about a patient that she had that had this significant amount of swelling on her face and arm and hand after the first vaccine um and uh anyway kim read that if if the patient were to take an ace inhibitor that it might prevent any swelling and wondered if you heard any read anything about this being evidence-based or evidence guided no i have not i have not interesting comment but i have not leslie any i haven't heard anything either okay okay thank you um and then this maybe is for cecilia um thompson do all labs have assays available to tech all the current variants it's a question from young young key markham so here i can answer for tri-core here at tri-core we are able to detect all of the major variants that are circulating in the u.s we're in constant contact with our tests and assay manufacturers to determine that that being said i don't know about every lab having that same communication but i would hope that they are doing the same as we as we are thank you cecilia just wanted to remind everyone that about 247 the cme link went into the chat as well um aline gush do you want to unmute and ask your a question a mini kind of mini case okay sure thank you um so this gentleman is 64 years old and he didn't have any underlying skin problems that we know of he hasn't had a rash in past he has a very widespread rash that is covering most of his body and it's the worst on his chest and upper back it's somewhat rough and pebbly textured there's been some weeping at times and he was given a course of oral prednisone [Music] a couple months ago and it was three days and it wasn't tapered um over the days and he became quite ill after that um after that the rash came back uh he said that he was given another course of prednisone but then they tapered it much more gradually but he was still somewhat ill so that that's right of course we don't really have that to offer him um i just started treating him with acupuncture and we had some improvement so far i'll be seeing him again today um but i i hadn't heard of anyone having a rash that lasted like this and was so widespread and it's been very itchy and and i had a lot of heat the entire time so i wondered if people have seen that and this is after after vaccination i'm sorry after vaccination the rash oh i'm sorry it was after his second shot of the moderna um the first shot was uneventful so he had the second one on february 19th and he still has the severe rash just as severe yeah no i haven't seen and and actually we i review a paper here a few weeks ago about the 12 cases of like rash associated with the with the mrna vaccines but they were really mild they were like localized in the elbows or around the area of injection for a few days after vaccination but i don't remember seeing this or he you know hearing at the description of a such a severe rush i don't know if you know maybe some of the primary care uh provider because i'm an infectious disease so i usually don't see the patient um in the communities but maybe somebody else have seen this more leslie thanks nestor let's see have you seen anything like this i have not elena actually sent me a picture of the ration it was a very impressive rash um of course we don't know 100 of us due to the vaccine you know uh although certainly timing wise it would make sense one thing i did recommend was at least um uh it's worth sending it into the american academy of dermatology as a registry for um post-vaccine rashes that they're sort of and i talked about it i think last week or the week before and it's worth sending it into that another thing is leslie we have a dermatology echo too on fridays at noon here and if you're in new mexico that might be something to consider as they they might see some dermatology um you know sequelae of the the vaccinations that's the possibility um maybe i could ask holly um who's our program coordinator to maybe send send you the link that would be great right um maybe we have time for uh kind of one more question if that's okay cynthia settles um has a really great question um and might just ask kind of everybody in our virtual room she says as we open up more what are other offices doing to see patients i'm a private pediatrician we have hepa filters in our rooms we currently see patients with coping symptoms in their car the whole office is vaccinated and my concerns are for the parents and kids coming in um coming in after and just kind of want to get a gestalt about kind of what you guys are doing are more and more of you seeing uh your ambulatory practice are you opening up your inventory practices um i know we don't do this but might you just chat in if you're you know if you're opening up just type in yes if you're not uh say no um i'll comment that we're seeing about half a third we'll say a third of our patients in clinic at this point um and about two-thirds are still telehealth um we're doing pretty much the same things we have we have had since the pandemic started we have someone screening at the front door and it's amazing how many people don't think the coffin fever actually apply to them and you know get back in the room and they're like oh well yeah it's just my usual allergies it's like ugh but um the hepa filters and we are very picky about the masks everyone has to wear a procedure mask if they come in with a cloth mask they're um and we have uh distancing and have um but it's still it is a little scary so most people thanks leslie most people are saying that they are seeing patients more and more in person right now um some are saying that they're just uh um seeing patients uh lean says that they're still being quite conservative so um my my sense is it's probably going to be opening up uh more and more and thanks holly holly lovely um just sent the dermatology echo tele teller registration so fantastic thanks holly um thanks leslie for that um just wanted to let you know we'll hold on to the the questions we didn't get to we have about a minute left we do have a few more echoes that i wanted to tell you about before the end of the call today we have a first responder echo at 2 p.m mountain time 4 pm eastern time it's with jennifer weiss she runs serenity mesa rehab center for patients in recovery from substance all substance use disorder she's a fantastic speaker she's going to talk about resiliency related to substance use disorder which you know has gone up about 20 in the united states since the copic pandemic hit um on this uh thursday we have the um indian health service mental health and resiliency although it is open to everybody and carla do we have the um critical care echo this thursday or is it is it next thursday yeah thanks joanna it's next thursday may 20th and it's on covid19 and children fantastic so that that'll be a great talk i wanted to thank dr sosa i want to thank dr hayes dr thompson and of course dr thornton and uh and primarily all of you guys for coming on to this call every week and we'll see you next week thank you\""
