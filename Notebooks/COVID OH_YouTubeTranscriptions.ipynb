       "\"good afternoon everyone welcome to the infectious diseases copen 19 office hours today well really nice to see everybody um i just have a couple housekeeping announcements and then we'll turn it over to nestor sosa um if you have questions during the during this session please put them into the chat and we'll try to get to all the questions we got a lot of questions last week but we'll try to get to all of the ones we can this week if you we would also ask that if you have a camera you would turn it on because we would love to see your faces we'd love to build community here at project echo um also if you um put questions into the chat and if you um we ask that you not answer other people's questions in the chat if they're directed at the hub team members and i want to just introduce myself on carl thornton infectious diseases physician and one of the associate directors here at project echo and i also want to introduce the co my co-facilitator joanna katzman joanna do you want to introduce yourself sure hi everybody i'm joanna katzman i'm a neurologist at project echo in university of new mexico welcome great thank you so much and just a couple of other uh other things today marla sivers our department of health uh expert who's usually with us is on vacation we're very happy for her and leslie hayes is as well so it's going to be nestor alone today like the old days um and i do not know there he is okay luckily nestor's here so um we're gonna go ahead and turn it over to him and we'll start with his um with his slides hi nestor do you want to introduce yourself sorry sorry for the delay i was trying to find the microphone once you open the the big screen you i lose the microphone hello everyone uh let's um go over our updates so but so we have more time i don't have to like run through my presentation like i usually do so i'll i'll go at a slower pace and we can enjoy some of these publications so first i wanted to start with some good news there was more um news communicated from from regeneron one of the companies that produce the monoclonal antibodies they actually in their webpage they uh reveal the results of one of the large phase three trials and this is using the monoclonal as prevention of disease so it's actually sort of a passive real passive immunity um and and what they they communicated was basically the following they said the prevention trial showed an 81 reduce risk of symptomatic uh sars coe2 infections with the use of subcutaneous administration of regen cough which is the the combination of two monoclonal uh cassidy map and in debbie map and they actually interestingly enough you said sub-q so that opens the the the ease of administration to other places not only hospital but it could be given in other in other settings with less complex nursing or medical support so that was interesting and and this this this was a double-blind placebo control study in which they included asymptomatic and obviously in uninfected household contacts of people with kobe and the exposure have to be less than four days so it's basically you know the typical example if your spouse or your brother in the same household is diagnosed probably they will offer an injection of of 1200 milligrams of of this regeneron monoclonal antibody and then they follow these cases and see who got infected and if they if they got infected who were symptomatic asymptomatic and what was the viral load so it was sort of an attempt to to protect uh people especially people that have not received the vaccine or are unable to mount a response to the vaccine this this would be the ideal use for this preparation and they actually share these tables on their web page this is not a publication again i i this is just a press release but it almost looks like a table from a from a study so they found an overall 81 percent reduction in symptomatic disease so those who got the the regeneron um did not develop disease uh in the same proportion of those who who were in the placebo arm and actually the protection was even higher in opposed the first week meaning that probably it was 72 in the first week and after the first week 93 so probably these some of these patients were already incubating the disease when they were injected um so you can see the protection was more robust after a couple of weeks probably ruling out ruling out the the fact that they were incubated this is when they were uh given the regeneron so definitely definitely a very high level of protection the other important uh thing is that the if you develop the disease if you fell ill with kobe despite the regeneron the duration of the disease was shorter 1.2 weeks so basically one week week versus three weeks of of illness if you did not develop the the regeneron so very significant also the p was very significant reduction in the duration of the disease and even the viral load uh was also um um significantly uh um shortened with with the with in the treatment are 0.4 versus 1.3 number of weeks with a positive viral load in those who got infected so definitely at least in this press relief evidence of of protection so if you have a person that it's uh unable to get the vaccine and they are exposed to covet in theory they can be offered this therapy so obviously regeneron is going to ask for an inclusion in their emergency use authorization by the fda inclusion of this indication uh as post-exposure prophylaxis or passive immunization so interesting very positive result with this monoclonal antibody and again as i said it was subcutaneous so it doesn't even need like an er visit it can be given in a less a complex setting and also i didn't mention it but the side effects were basically comparable in the placebo and the regeneron very little difference between placebo and and the and the monoclonal in terms of serious diversity injection related adverse events so it was really very very well tolerated and the second news i basically um mentioned something about this uh uh when we had the meeting last week but the news had not been uh uh already communicated but i mentioned that there was some concern especially in europe with the j j pacinos and as you know the johnson and johnson one of the adenoviruses vaccine the single dose that was going to be uh used here in the u.s as one of the three um approved vaccinations is is pause or their administration is possible the the authorities are analyzing this phenomenon of the trombonic event so i want to go in a little bit more detail into these uh thrombotic events um and actually the cdc if you look at the cdc webpage they they posted a hannah health alert network um mentioned in this phenomenon of the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with trombocytopenia after the receive of johnson and johnson kobe 19 maxine and it's been no longer the news so you can read more information at the cdc.gov webpage about this and i just want to mention because the most striking finding was this cavernous sinus thrombosis i just want to go over some because i mean this is not something that we see all the time so the cavernous sinus is sort of a of a venus lake inside the bones of the skull and it's located right right behind the eye so here would be the eye so it's sort of behind the eye and it's actually like the confluence of many of these important venus um systems inside the inside the skull they they actually draining this area and this is an area where the blood flow is kind of slow it's sort of of a lake of blood if you if you if you can use this this um term so so it's one of the areas where there's blood clotting in these in these vaccinated subjects in the cavernous sinus and this is a very critical area because in in the in cavernous dinos there's a lot of important structures there are several cranial nerves that go through the cavernous sinus and even the carotid artery the internal carotid artery is within this this venous leg or venous sinus inside the brain so it's a very delicate very critical so you have thrombosis of that you can uh easily explain a lot of the neurological findings because of of damage to the to the nerves or other structures that are in close proximity we usually see cavernous sinus thrombosis in infectious disease when there is like an infection for instance of the sphenoid uh sinus when there's sphenoid sinus sinusitis sometimes the infection uh produces a clotting of the blood inside the same sinus but obviously this is a completely different phenomenon associated with the vaccine and in fact in the cdc uh web pages what they reported so far are um you know out of 6.85 million doses of jnj given in the u.s we have six reports of cavernous sinus from bostis and these patients all had less than 150 000 platelets but that was like the combination of the of the finding that actually was the alert in the in the vaccine adverse event uh reporting system in the virus uh so it's if you if you make a simple uh division here it's one almost one in a million or a little bit less than one in a million um so it's it's a very infrequent event but nevertheless rare and and and in one case was lethal the onset of this complication was between six and 13 days after vaccination and actually median time from vaccination to hospitalization with the complication was 15 days so it's not something that happens immediately after the vaccine like an hour or a day it's actually more like a couple of weeks after 10 days to a couple of weeks after the vaccination and the range goes from 10 to 17 days uh between the the vaccination and hospitalization interestingly enough six out of six subjects uh with this event were female so 100 at least in this um the us um and relatively young 18 to 48 if you think that that a lot of elderly people receive the vaccine this phenomenon has been recognized mostly in young um females half of them were obese but the other half were not uh and none had a history of any coagulation uh disorder so they were you know presumably healthy from the hematologic point of view so so that that's basically the description of the phenomenon the five out of six the presenting symptom was headaches so they have headache one out of out of of the six have back pain but then develop headaches so we can say that almost a hundred percent six out of six develop headache four oxy six had also neurologic syndromes like blur vision localized weakness etc uh and one presented with abdominal pain nausea and vomiting and this all also reminds me that there were clotting in other areas when they studied this patient they found also clotting in in the splatnic uh circulation meaning the portal vein or the mesenteric veins inside the abdomen so it's not just a cavernous sinus but there is clotting in other places and even disseminated into a vascular population in i think one of the patients the other thing that i mentioned all had low platelets so that's another hallmark of the disease and actually the range was between 10 000 which is very low to 120 000 uh and there was also pairing intraparenchymal bleeding in four hours because you have thrombosis but you have trouble cytopenia and bleeding so so you can have both uh bleeding and thrombosis in the in the in the patient out of these six so far one have died two have recovered and were discharged and three at the moment of this analysis remain hospitalized and in also interesting from the diagnostic standpoint five out of five tests it's all of the those who have the test for the pf4 or plate activating antibodies against the um protein factor four in the platelets were positive so all of them had this anti-pf4 antibody which is also the diagnostic whole market of these the the production of these antips4 antibodies and what is pa4 pf4 basically it's called plated factor four it's actually a 70 amino acid protein also known as chemokine ligand iv or cxcl4 but i think you know it's more better known as ps4 it's a it's a protein that is normally released by the alpha granules the playlists have these granules that have this ps4 and they they participate in the normal um coagulation physiology so they they um they are released by activated platelets and promote um blood coagulation um by moderate moderating the effects of heparin-like molecules so it's a physiologic function but what we think is happening here is that um antibodies are produced against this pf4 and and this antibody are conducive of platelet aggregation and this is what happened exactly with the heparin industrial homocytopenia and with the pf4 it's complex with um with heparin and then the antibodies actually cross link the platelets uh using the fc receptor in the platelet surface and there is like platelet aggregation plated activation and and and scientists think that this is the same phenomenon except that there's no heparin here no natural no no pharmacological use of heparin is actually something in the vaccine that is triggering these auto antibodies against pf4 and those antibodies together with the pf4 are mediating these um platelet aggregations so that's that's what we know uh about this so far so what do i think are the the future of this adenovirus there are several things happening obviously the paws have been extended they want actually to look at more subjects because when they did the analysis there were a lot of of subjects who had received the johnson and joseph vaccine were less than two weeks so we just by waiting a few days we're gonna have another um close to three million people who already had the vaccine and have completed uh those 14 days after the vaccine and see if we see more of this phenomenon so the real alternative is just continue the vaccination so maybe the cc will say you know we're gonna put this in context it's one in a in a million it's a really really rare and and the advantages um of the vaccines it's greater than the risk so we're going to continue another another strategy would be to continue the the vaccines but limited for certain either age or gender maybe just use it on males like some countries are doing or maybe only people over 50 years and with the risk of dying of coffee is higher than the risk of of having this adverse event this rare bets event and the other thing would be not using it all together i mean if if the the cases keep piling up and we see that it's more common that initially perceive there may be governments um that may not use it all together because they have other vaccines so those are i think some of the some of the possibilities going going forward and we can discuss in the session of question and answer the other key question that i think for me as a as a physician as an investigator it's really what component of the vaccine is causing this autoimmune reaction because remember there's a lot of people who have received also the sputnik vaccine which is an adenovirus vaccine in other places in other countries so what component of is the adenovirus itself is is is the spike protein that is being produced uh it's a contaminant in these adenovirus vaccines or something we don't really know i have read a couple of papers speculating about what could the trigger for this for the production of this pf4 and the other thing is you know we so far we have seen females young but um it's true that a lot of people who have been vaccinated because they're healthcare workers there a lot of them are female so this really a real um greater incidence in female or males can also have it and i read that in the phase three trial of of johnson and so there was one male who had cabernet synonymous thrombosis so at least there's one report of this complication in in males um and also maybe the age we say they're all young but but again maybe maybe not we're not recognizing this complication in other in the elderly because you know you expect the elderly to have strokes or or cns complication more more frequently than than young so maybe it's it's um it's been picked up because this is a young person developing but it could be also happening in the early but we're just not picking it up so i think those are questions that are still open and obviously the question of sputnik um if it's going to be affected also i hope the countries that are using this vaccine are doing a robust uh monitoring of their cases and finally if we eliminate this adenovirus vaccine is that going to affect i think definitely it's going to affect the the kobe response in the in the global scale because a lot of countries were counting on either astra seneca or johnson and johnson to vaccinate their population so it's going to be a large impact around the world because these are vaccines that do not require the street uh frozen temperature et cetera so so it was really convenient and johnson and jose was one though so that's another advantage that we're losing in this case okay so obviously i have to mention something about the variance variance of concern and there were some two publications in the la into all the lancet uh journals about good news about the voc or variants of concerns specifically the the the british or uk varian the first paper was this paper called genomic characteristics and clinical effect of the emergence horoscope ii uh b117 this is the uk in london so what these authors did they look at the patients actually hospitalized with kobe in the time between november and december of last year when the the b117 was becoming more frequent so there were patients with no b b117 and we be of b117 so with variance of concern and non-variants are concerned they actually compare the severity of disease and what they found which was reassuring and it was a sort of different to what had been uh reported before it was that severe disease or death um prevalence ratio was similar in both the boc and non-blc patients there was no significant difference in the severity of disease with either with or without the the uk variant so what that was that was really reassuring in this well-conducted study and and the only thing that they did did confirm was that the viral load was higher in those with with the variance so and that sort of explained probably why it's more transmissible at least from this paper um this paper is is contradicting previous reports of more severity with the b117 and as you know this is the more frequent um variant in the united states so it's definitely good news this was published in the landsat infectious disease and these are basically the distribution of the severe cases and death and you can see that just at a glance the the incidence is very similar of severe disease and death with both the non-boc and blc across a different age group maybe a small difference here in the mortality and the younger folks but definitely not a statistically significant so the conclusion of this paper more transmissible but not more severe and that was good news and there was another paper also from from the uk this is sort of a population um report of people with the that use that the app to report uh reinfections in the us thirty six thousand in the uk i'm sorry thirty six thousand nine hundred and twenty app users uh who who were followed for the the development of reinfection they found no changes in the symptoms so there was no difference in the clinical presentation and and disease duration with the b117 or with non biba 117 patients and also no evidence of a greater frequency of reinfection so two two publications sort of diffusing a little bit the concern that we all have with these new variants um uh and definitely this demonstrated an increase in the in the transmissibility also so apparently more robust data that definitely this b117 is more transmissible but necessary not necessarily more severe so good news in the front and my favorite article that this is me and my my bicycle my favorite article of the week and this sort of a personal story when in the beginning of the pandemic there was no treatment no vaccine nothing and i thought the only thing i can do is like to try to stay in shape and do exercise in case i ended up in the icu that was sort of my crazy idea so i increased my my exercise during the the pandemic and long and behold this group actually published that physical inactivity is associated with a higher risk of severe kobe 19 so so my gut feeling that i needed to be in good shape to survive kobe was right they did a retrospective review almost 50 000 subjects in in case kaiser permanente southern california uh health system um they actually had information on the activity level of these subjects from the ehr they they uh apparently they do as a routine they do what they call exercise vital signs so every time the patient goes to the to the clinic they asking how many times a week do you exercise in the last two months and how many minutes do you exercise and they have this sort of uh information on all of these subjects on what their level of activity and they actually classify consistently inactive those who did less than 10 minutes a week some activity 11 to 149 and then consistently active which is like the cdc recommendation more than 150 days of at least breeze walking or some type of physical exercise and then they correlated this information from the pre-pandemic era on these subjects with their their outcomes in if they got kobe and what they found that the risk of hospitalization was two times a higher 2.5 times higher the icu admission and risk of death also 2. almost 2.5 so risk if you were inactive versus consistently active so there was a clear a clear protection if you if you can can use that that term protection from being physically active as opposed to and this was a multi-variable logistic regression so he included all the fractures like obesity hypertension diabetes so this was significant after adjusting for probable confounders and even if you were inactive versus some activity there was still some some protection obviously not as robust but a 20 a 10 and a 32 a higher risk of having either hospitalization icu admission and death if you were inactive so it's a good thing to stay active during a pandemic you know to try to decrease your risk of of being hospitalized et cetera and obviously why is this we know this from previous studies we know that exercising improved immune function there's lower incident intensity and mortality with other viral infections have been published with influenza and some other obviously exercise reduces systemic inflammation that we know is part of the pathophysiology of kovid and also obvious cardiovascular benefits increase lung capacity increase muscle strength so you if you end up in an icu you're probably better off if you're if you're in good shape as opposed to if you have like um you're not physically fit and also improve mental health which i found this interesting at least if you have better mental health probably more likely to behave appropriately use mass social distance as opposed to to a person who who um who's depressed or or not following uh things because of emotional or other psychological reasons and obviously their indirect effects of exercise over obesity diabetes and hypertension that we all know very well okay so that was my update for today thank you thank you very much nestor for that excellent update and your personal experience with exercise congratulations so that's great um before we move on to questions i wanted to introduce our colleagues from tricor carissa culbreth are you on video you're not on my screen but i wanted you to introduce yourself and also if you have any updates that you would like to give us hi karissa kobreth the medical director for infectious disease diagnostics at tricor and just a reminder to all of our colleagues on the line this is medical laboratory professionals week so make sure that you go to wherever your lab is or send them an email and say thank you for all of the hard work they do for covit and for everything else and so that's my only update for today happy to answer any questions thank you chris and cecilia thompson is i believe also on i don't know cecilia if you had any anything any updates hey i don't have anything to update i would second chris's comment um to thank your favorite laboratory professional for all that they do great thank you well i'm thanking you guys publicly here on echo for all of the work that you do in the lab uh very very critical to our to us doing a good job in medicine all right um i am going to turn it over to joanna to start with questions great thank you carla uh thank you nestors so much for that outstanding presentation today and and every week just amazing um going to start with um dr seibold's question um it's about the regeneron monocle antibody nester he's uh and harry says um is the regeneron monocle antibody only for those high risk people or for all patients is only for use with patients developing symptoms or can it be used after a known exposure prior to symptoms or proposed exposure prophylaxis right so far it's just a proof for um for patients who who have copied or are beginning copied in the sa and they have the risk factor the same risk factor that that are described for eli lilly so over 65 obesity et cetera the risk factors that are in the eu of all the eli lily and and and and the general product um the hope for for the general company for this product is that that the indication will be broadened to basically include a high-risk exposure let's say a person who did not get the vaccine because i had like an underlying disease and it's exposed either at home or some other setting to a person with kobe then maybe you can offer the monoclonal obviously if you're being vaccinated and you're fully immunized there's probably no use but but i can i can think of patients like renal transplant patient patients with the congenital immunodeficiencies that are not able to produce and if they get exposed to copy they can offer they can be offered but this is not approved yet they're gonna actually present the data from the phase three to the fda to to have this indication in their in their uh portfolio but not it's not um available for that at this point it's it's the hope of rainieron to have it um to use use it that way as a prophylactic especially in groups that have not been vaccinated or they have not mounted a good response on the vaccine or they are susceptible to infection because of other reasons immunological recent genetic reasons et cetera thank you nester it reminds me how it reminds me of what's what's kind of going on in michigan and how the federal agencies are not shipping more vaccines to michigan but said they were going to be shipping more monoclonal antibodies and i'm wondering kind of how how that's being handled and if it's helping or working or if they're if patients are really coming in to get to get treatment um john foster says related to the same thing is there any talk of loosening criteria for monoclonal antibodies john do you want to unmute and ask this tell us about uh this patient of yours yeah can you hear me yes absolutely yeah so there was a patient that was seen in our er last week who they considered monoclonal antibodies but he was 53 he he barely missed the criteria because if he had been 55 he would have met criteria because he has hypertension so he did not get it and then and now last night he got admitted now now hypoxic and and so it there there we have it seems like at least in taos we have a an abundance of supply of the monoclonal antibody and and we would like to be using it more often it would be nice to be able to give it to more people and i'm just wondering if there's any thought about kind of loosening those um criteria that they're defined as the high-risk conditions great question john yeah great question i i don't know the answer i agree with you i mean there are some cases in which you i mean a 53 54 year old with underlying condition it's it's almost painful not to give it to him because he's not 55 so yeah i agree it's definitely something that that hopefully the fda will will consider now that we have more data on safety because at the beginning there was really no not too much data but now we have a couple of phase three both in prevention and therapy and especially early on they seem to be very effective the diminishing hospitalization symptomatic disease even viral shedding or viral load decreases also duration of disease so um i think it's it's yeah your question is right on the spot i can i can also share a case that i had here uh we had a patient who had like a complete inability to produce antibodies he has excellent agama global anemia and he had a prolonged covet um you know he got infected in march and still in april was still very sick with fever elevated inflammatory markers and i actually requested permission to use the in this case was the eli lily because he had no ability to produce antibodies and we gave him the the monoclonal sort of you know outside the eua with you know with the consent of the patient and my sort of responsibility and i don't know it was a coincidence or what but the patient got much better uh 48 hours after the infusion the fear went down for the first time in a month he started having less oxygen requirement and was discharged like three days into the the after the infusion um so yeah i think that the indication should be broadened and we should consider other settings in which we can use these these uh monoclonals because they're actually very consistent this 80 percent 85 percent um ability to prevent severe disease it's been constant in both the eli lily and the and the regenerator and there's another one coming from jsk and dir which is another monoclonal that i think is requesting in ua so we're going to have at least three maybe four monoclonals to use in different uh type of patients so i i totally agree thanks john for the for that thought-provoking question i hope your patient is doing doing okay right now thanks nestor um david tempest um do you want to unmute and ask your question about the met uh the mode of administration the sub q versus the infusion if not um my connection is uh that's okay yeah is this unstable yeah no problem let me let me yeah yeah i'll read it for you thank you um so nestor um david's question is that um that given that the previous monoclonal antibodies have been infusions based on adding kind of significant antibodies uh what what do you what do you think the mechanism of the subq injection is that's a great question i i don't know i i don't know i mean the how you can use i mean how can you why you need to use an ib and then you can use a sub q i really don't know i remember like for instance um and this is going way back uh when we used uh ige ibig for prevention of hepatitis b in the in the good old times when we use like ibie or people who who were gonna travel to places where there was some diminishing of some diseases we were given like a subcutaneous ingestion of immunoglobulin so i guess it's the same same principle you don't need to use ib you can use a sub-q but honestly i don't know the difference uh the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the this antibody injection subcutaneous as opposed to intravenous but it's definitely very convenient i mean i can almost think of a treatment in a pharmacy um you know if you if you develop kobe you call your you have your opposite you call your doctor the doctor can call the pers so the injection in the pharmacy and you can get it in your in your pharmacy right away the same day you don't have to go to an emergency room and and get an iv set up et cetera so i think it's very very useful uh if we use it you know rapidly and an efficient efficient way absolutely what what this makes me think of is you know i primarily see patients with headaches and there's now three fda approved you know preventive medications for migraines that are all immune biological agents that are all monthly subcutaneous injections just like this and one of them the one of the four is an um intravenous um preparation so somehow it's working just fine as a subject subcutaneous preparations so maybe i'll look i'll look into that and bring that back next week um deborah mcgrew do you want to i'm not exactly sure um what your question is do you want to unmute and ask your question about the if patients need to be maybe screened uh better before their j j vaccine yes thank you um yeah i didn't quite mean that i meant um in that study who said that people did not have coagulation history of coagulation disorders and so i wondered was that just their history or were they actually screened for um coagulation disorders after they developed a thrombotic event that's a good question i think it was basically on the history because this is the information uh gathered from the vaccine adverse event reports so i guess the medical history of those patients before they had this traumatic event was negative but i i mean some of them were still hospitalized with trombocitopenia so i doubt they were able to do like uh much studies at that point i think it was more the history they're probably asking have you had have you ever had a dbt or a pe no that that was it that was probably it or not no uh genetic coalition disorder like hemophilia or something so they probably said no but it was probably just historical i i'd be surprised if they they have some pre uh event or post event data at this point well i would wonder i mean i know some adults who've you know had their first event in their 50s or you know and had a had a kind of quiescent clotting disorder anyway thank you nestor there's some more questions including one run from myself um about the j j uh vaccine one is from sandra murdoch saying do you know the woman who had the cavernous sinus thrombosis were on birth control pills um i also wanted to know if the patients who recovered and left the hospital if they had kind of lasting neurological deficits such as cranial nerve palsies um and then um and then there's another question from yomi tadper have you heard of other cloud events with the mrna vaccines so those kind of three questions right no i don't know the answer to the first part i mean i haven't i i haven't seen them if they were or not using birth control pills obviously um estrogen in general are a predisposing factor but i didn't see a report of the use of australians in these patients and again i think it has to do with the fact that and that's one of some of the things that i think they're looking into with the astra seneca and with the jnj vaccine um but i don't i don't think i saw any any information on the on the medication that they were using uh honestly and and i think what i saw about mrnas and thrombotic events um it seems to be really rare i mean they have given almost 200 million doses and they have not reported this type of events obviously there are people who normally are going to develop dvts and pes and i even remember i think in the in the studies but not that i know uh cabernet synonymous thrombosis or splenic splatnic vein thrombosis i haven't seen that in in almost 200 vaccinies uh according to what the cdc mentioned so so if if if it occurs it's really extremely rare more rare than than what we're seeing with the astra seneca and the jnj great uh thank you nestor um back to you carla thank you joanna um there there's just one more question about before we leave that the jnj vaccine so since there is at risk since there is that risk for possible blood clots with the j j vaccine would it be reasonable to counsel patients and consider changing to progesterone only birth control yeah i don't know i honestly don't know that answer good thought i don't know the other question that it's a natural question is should we if we vaccinate with j and j a young female should she take aspirin or something i don't think so but that's thoughts that are coming into people's mind like can you do something to prevent it i mean it's so rare that one in a million you have to to use a lot of antiquivalence uh to prevent one case but it's something that that colleagues have asked me i mean if i give this to my sister she should be taking aspirin you know i don't know she just stopped the birth control pill for for a month we don't really know i mean we have i think we need to to see more data to answer the question that you are asking i mean where all of these uh patients on on birth control or not if they were not then that doesn't make sense to to do a change in that um and also understand the the phenomenon you know what's causing the because maybe something that is correctable if it's something like a contaminant or or or something that is in the vaccine maybe they can they can eliminate that or or try to diminish the the that ingredient and and prevent that from occurring but we don't know yet what's causing this if this is the vector or or or something else yeah thank you uh really complex issue um there's a question there's actually a couple of comments and a question from bruce tempest about um nestor i'm not sure if you read that the editorial in the in the albuquerque journal last week about herd immunity in new mexico um if you did not did you no i did not i did not i'm sorry i don't know carissa did you read it so actually i was taking a look at it during um this call since there were a couple questions that came up i think the the overall conclusion of the article um you know was is that herd immunity is a journey and that there's a percentages at which we um begin that journey um i think that the data around when herd immunity is actually achieved um are quite clear and so so i think the the author was speaking to um the beginning of the journey of herd immunity um we are certainly not there because we still continue to see cases um persist and you know we're not quite at a point where we're seeing consistently declining cases i think we're seeing a leveling of the number of cases but that that does not indicate herd immunity because we should start to see fewer and fewer cases every week rather than a pretty flat number and we still get some spikes um and and we're still um still have quite a few restrictions um that are happening on capacity and gatherings and we're continuing to wear masks and do social distancing um so we have a lot of mitigation efforts that are helping to contain the infection so all of those things together i think it lets us know that we are with the vaccination efforts that we've been doing the department of health has been rolling them out very well in new mexico i don't think that we've yet achieved herd immunity but we are definitely on well on our way but all of the mitigation efforts still need to stay in place as we get there thank you thank you carissa um there's a couple of questions esther about your physical activity um paper that you were talking about uh fred fox said the relationship of activity and severity of illness is a correlation and not a not necessarily a cause the inactive individuals likely had more comorbidities was any attempt made to eliminate confounding variables yes they did yeah yes that's a great question obviously there is obviously some relationship in that but yeah they did they did that just for like underlying condition diabetes obesity cardiovascular disease in that study but i agree this is a retrospective review of charts so it's not a prospective double blind placebo control i mean they didn't put people to exercise and not exercise and then they saw if they die morocco it is a retrospective review and we have learned we have learned painfully during this pandemic that retrospective reviews have a lot of limitations so the logical the next logical thing that is not going to occur is to actually uh you know take a sample of people and and ask them to do regular exercise and then uh you know and and placebo group normally normal activity and then see if they're actually uh there is a difference but this is sort of a hint of an association or correlation as was mentioned yeah this is not a proof of cost in any way but they did they did try to correct from confounders obviously because that's the obvious thing obesity hypertension cardiovascular disease diabetes are are clear confounders and and in general people with obesity diabetes hypertension uh for many reasons are not necessarily the most active uh uh so so it's a logical thing to think but but they did they corrected for that but i but there's that caveat that this is a retrospective chart review with all the limitations of that type of design thank you very much um there's a multi-part question about the variants from sylvia metzger i'm going to ask all of it and see if let's see how effective do the current vaccines appear to be against covet variants that's the first part of the question and which variants are we most concerned about and the last question is how widely or implemented is genomic testing right now to sort of see what what variants we're potentially working with here looking at here in new mexico right okay so yeah so first of all i think in general the efficacy of the vaccines against severe disease with with almost all of the variants is very good i mean we have seen even even um even the the johnson and johnson maxine the astra seneca and obviously the mrna vaccine are very good at protecting against severe disease and hospitalization across all variants so far so i think and there are people who are actually calling eric topple from the scripps institute is calling the variants escarians because we we are really scared about these variants but but a lot of the data doesn't support that they are really you know that either deadly or or unable to be inhibited by the protection given by the by the vaccine so i think across the board if you look at severe disease uh almost all vaccine seems to protect against severe disease with with all all of the variants if you look if you if you take a step backward and you just look at the neutralizing antibodies there are some difference obviously i have shown slides to that regard um especially the the south african and the brazilian variant tend to the antibodies that you have after vaccination are not as as high the neutralizing antibodies are not as high against those variants so there's sort of a drop in the in the potency of the neutralizing antibodies but that but that doesn't mean that clinically is going to translate into more severe diseases and in fact we haven't seen that and there's so the other side of the coin is the t cell immunity and i actually was reviewing some uh some papers yesterday about how robust the the immune response the cellular immune response to the variants are the spike protein has more than 20 to 30 epitopes so areas in which the t cells recognize the protein as foreign and modifying one or two with this variant is not going to nullify the the t cell response so there's also that sort of backup of the immune system of the t cell that is also giving protections against the virus so so yeah so i think um all of the vaccines seems to be really good preventing disease maybe symptomatic disease against the south african some of the vaccines are affected but definitely they're they're really good at preventing and definitely we have shown with the uk wagon which is the one in the us um we have seen that is very effective they have been able to flatten the curve both in the uk and in in israel where they have a high percentage of circulation of this variant so at least uh for what we worried right now that the v117 seems to be completely susceptible to even the astra seneca vaccine in the uk and obviously to the mrna and other vaccines here in the u.s regarding new mexico i think i showed data last week um that there are there there is a group both at the at the the lab at the national lab here and at the at unm um collaborating with all the the laboratories looking for the for for the genetics of the virus circulating in the community and there's actually this very nice collaboration and new mexico is one of the top in the country regarding the percentages of of of samples that are being sequenced so we are right there i think number five number seven in the country in percentage of cases that have been um sequence so we're really you know monitoring these uh both the department of health unm the private labs like tricor and others are actually collaborating and sending sending uh samples so so we are looking into the into the different variants and as i mentioned last week um we have here the california variance of concern of uh the 427 and 429 and we have also the the uk variant those are like the three top uh circulating they're very you know few cases of the south african or p1 uh in in our area it's mostly the california variants and and obviously the increasing like in the rest of the country of the b117 or the uk variant i think i answered the the two most concerning are p1 and and and 351 which is uh the uk and the i'm sorry the the south african and the brazilian are the the more concerning variants because of the impact on neutralizing antibodies but with all the caveats that i mentioned thank you thank you for that um i want to just let everybody know that the cme link just went into the chat so if you would like see me please fill that out and we would love to get your feedback about the office hours um one more question from me nestor uh melvina mccabe bam bamlan ivab eua was revoked by the fda is this is this correct do you know about that mister yeah i don't know if it's revoked or they actually uh recommended that it's not used alone so that it's always used with the ssl map and it has to do with the efficacy against some of these variants that we were talking that apparently bangladesh loses the efficacy against some of the variants circulating in the u.s so it didn't make sense to keep using it as a monotherapy because when you see the patient for the first time you don't know if he has a variant of concern or an old or an old variant that is susceptible to the bam bomb dynamic map so the recommendation was that everybody should give the combination therapy which is band anemium and at the same map or regeneron which is already a combination of two monoclonals but not van linimium alone but yeah i think they're not using or they're not recommending monotherapy anymore because of that because you you can have you know 20 30 40 of your of your patients with uh with a variant that is resistant to the body map so so it's like a gamble to use it and and and it may not be effective so that that's what i know about the the new recommendation that you have to use a butter in combination with eta cetera thank you nestor um somebody asked about this email like it went in at a 12 47 if you go go back in the chat you can find it and with that i'm going to turn it back up over to joanna thanks thanks so much carla um martha d'ambrosio asked a question about uh jama about the journal jama discussing thrombocytopenia also with mrna vaccines and the pl4 antibody also and wanted it she wanted to get your tate take on that nester um yeah i haven't i haven't seen that article i mean i really looked into that and and i actually um you know read part of the the the or was listening to part of the meeting with the with the the vaccine at cdc and i i i mean i haven't heard anything about specifically about thrombosis and trauma side opinion there are cases of thrombocytopenia um associated with with um with mrna vaccine but it's it's basically uh the normal you know occurrence of thrombocytopenia itp and others that occur when you vaccinate you know a lot of people you're gonna have people with purpura basically um in your population but it's not i haven't seen that phenomenon or the thrombosis and trombocytopenia caused by or associated directly with an mrna vaccine that's what i meant but obviously there are there are patients with trouble cytopenia and there are patients with thrombosis there are patients who who were vaccinated and developed dbt or pe for other reasons but but not related um at least no culturally related to the vaccine right thanks nestor and then adella whole green uh kind of said are our patients with thrombocytopenia good candidates for any kind of copic uh 19 uh vaccine so a lot of questions about thrombocytopenia um and then jerry uh wilms kind of mentions what you said about the fact that there might be under reporting of kind of venous thrombosis and dbt and other kinds of uh issues especially with elderly or kind of patients with kind of comorbidities because it's kind of harder to tease out so thank you for that um and uh fred fox is is happy that you're getting exercise [Laughter] um and then uh harry do you want to unmute um and ask about the the b117 um yeah hi good morning um i had read perhaps a week or two weeks ago that the b117 variant was becoming the dominant strain across the u.s is that still current thinking or is that just regionalized in parts of california and parts of the west i was wondering what you thought nestor yeah yes good question thank you yeah the i i saw the data from the cdc and they actually if you look in this if you look in the cc webpage they have a nice color graph i don't have it off hand but uh in which they they show the different percentage and i think recently b117 became the predominant in the us as a whole it i think it was 27 if i remember correctly it was around 27 of all of all uh variants of concern or all variants was the b117 and then there was a whole array of others in new mexico is i the latest data that i saw um it was not that high not 27 it was below that and we have a mix of b117 and the two california uh variants as the more prevalent in new mexico which is logical because we're really you know close to to arizona and california but that that's what i saw um and actually what do kowalenski uh in the press like a couple weeks ago actually announced that officially the b117 was the more common or the most common variant in the u.s at this point but it's still around 30 percent uh you know national in in the national uh frequency not not higher than that yet nestor can i this is joanna i'm gonna just uh ask you a couple questions about that i my understanding is that it was first my remembering from the media and from studies is that it really kind of first got noticed entering the kind of u.s population that are in around kind of december or january so that really like in three four months it really has taken over as the number one uh strain is that is that right yeah that is correct exactly and in fact in the uk it was noticed in september and it became you know uh the most frequent in december so it was also very rapidly uh substituting the other the other invariants so from from like september to december went from like very small percentage to 90 of the of the strange especially in east london and some other areas in the uk it really uh you know became really prevalent right and so when companies like pfizer and modern are talking about perhaps a booster uh or a third shot for many americans you know this year are are they gonna you know think about the same uh the same kind of material or are they going to think about you know something more robust against kind of this strain or what is your thought on that that's a good question i think it's it's hard to predict my fear is that because this this problem changes so rapidly that if they start making one for b1 one seven maybe b117 will not be of an issue six months down the road when they when they do the studies and start using it so it's kind of uh difficult but yeah i have heard this conversation about booster already i i heard peter hotel is talking about a booster after six months uh the pfizer ceo mentioning also that the need for a booster in in a few in a few a month it's possible i mean we do it with influenza every year so it wouldn't be the first time that we need to do like you know sequential boostering and it makes sense if one of these variants in which the neutralizing antibody really goes down like the uk or i'm sorry the south africa or the brazilian become prevalent uh it would probably make sense to to give better protection to do a new uh vaccine more specific for that for those variants but i think this is something that is so fluid that is very hard to predict and there's also there are people experts who actually believe that the immune protection of the t cell immunity what i was mentioning before prevents severe disease and apparently none of the variants affect cell immunity because the t cells react to many epitopes so they actually recognize different areas 23 30 something depending if it's cd4 or cda they actually recognize a lot of areas in the spike protein so a change in one or two or three it's not going to nullify the effect against all of the other epitopes in the in the spike protein so so you know if being optimistic maybe we're not going to need a booster so soon we're going to be nervous because the neutralizing antibodies go down but probably the severe disease protection will last a little bit longer than six months and and that's we're going to have to actually accrue that information when we keep monitoring the epidemic we will see that that nobody's dying of cobit hopefully or no severe uh patients no hospitalization would cover despite having been vaccinated six or nine or ten months uh before so if we see that there may not be a need for a for a booster at six months maybe a year or maybe longer because you're gonna have this protection against the video this is lasting longer that's what i i'm trying to interpret from what i'm reading especially regarding the t-cell immunity that seems to be more diverse and more long-lasting than the that the b cell and the neutralizing antibodies that seem to after six months start like falling in the curves that i've seen okay super helpful uh really helpful um one qu one question i've heard that india i don't know if you've heard any i know that india has kind of also taken a downward uh course and and is doing quite poorly well related to covet and i've heard that they're having trouble with even a couple of their different variants on their spike protein can you comment any that you know anything about that nester i've just heard the news i mean the headlines that is going up i know that there's a lot of a lot of the population is very large in india they haven't really achieved vaccination of a large percentage of the population and interestingly you know the same phenomenon is occurring in europe believe it or not europe vaccination percentages except for the uk which is sort of an outlier the rest of the european countries are going through lockdowns uh uh you know the fourth wave or the third wave whatever of kobe despite having the vaccines and i think it has to do with the fact that uh here in the u.s the mrna vaccines were acquired really early and they were used and we have been vaccinating people since december in europe they're they're countries that are less than 10 to 20 of the population have received the first dose um and and they're using they were using astrazeneca or planning to use johnson and johnson and now they are stuck with the with this complication so it's been really complicated in india and the same phenomenon occurs in south america like chile and brazil are having a significant number of cases i'm in contact with some of my colleagues in chile and brazil and they're going through through hell literally they have no oxygen no beds no it's really a horrible situation in latin america despite the fact that they're starting to vaccinate their people and chile is actually pretty much advanced but they still having a lot of cases it's it's hard thank you nestor so much i think we're pretty much out of time wanted to thank nestor you so much thanks uh carissa um thank you cecilia thanks carla had to leave a couple of minutes early but i want to thank
